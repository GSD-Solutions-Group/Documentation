### IT Department:

## Purpose
This standard operating procedure (SOP) outlines the steps and responsibilities involved in managing technology when an employee departs from the organization. The purpose is to ensure the secure and efficient transition of technology assets and data, protect sensitive information, and maintain continuity of operations.
## Scope 
This applies to all employees who resign, are terminated, or complete their contracts with the organization. It covers the deactivation of user accounts, retrieval of company-owned equipment, data backup, confidentiality measures, knowledge transfer, and documentation.
## Responsibilities 
Human Resources (HR): Notifies the IT department of the employee's departure and provides necessary details.
IT Department: Executes the procedures outlined in this SOP and ensures compliance with security and data protection measures.
Employee's Supervisor: Collaborates with HR and the IT department to facilitate the return of equipment and the transfer of responsibilities.

## Prerequisites
HR or the employee's supervisor must notify the IT department promptly upon the employee's departure.
IT staff must have access to the necessary systems and administrative privileges to deactivate accounts and manage technology assets.

## Procedures
Notification Process:

HR or the employee's supervisor informs the IT department of the impending departure, providing the employee's name, last working day, and reason for departure.
Account Deactivation:

IT deactivates the employee's user accounts across all systems and applications, including email, network access, and other relevant platforms.
Disable or suspend the employee's access to cloud services, shared folders, and internal databases.
Password Reset:

IT resets the employee's passwords for all systems to prevent access to accounts and sensitive information.
Communicate new passwords to relevant parties requiring access, if necessary.
Email Management:

Set up an automatic email response on the employee's account, indicating that the individual is no longer with the organization and providing alternative contact information, if applicable.
Forward incoming emails to the appropriate team member or manager to ensure important communications are not missed.
Data Backup and Retrieval:

Identify and back up critical data or files owned or accessed by the departing employee to prevent data loss.
Archive or transfer relevant files and documents to a centralized location or the employee's successor, following organizational policies.
Equipment Collection:

Coordinate with HR or the employee's supervisor to collect all company-owned devices, such as laptops, smartphones, tablets, and other hardware.
Verify the inventory of returned equipment and assess its condition for potential repairs or refurbishment.
Confidentiality and Intellectual Property:

Remind the departing employee of their obligations regarding the protection of confidential information and intellectual property.
Reinforce the importance of not disclosing or using such information after leaving the organization.
Obtain the employee's signature on any non-disclosure or intellectual property agreements, if necessary.
Exit Interview and Knowledge Transfer:

Conduct an exit interview with the departing employee to gather feedback and insights.
Facilitate knowledge transfer sessions with the employee's replacement or relevant team members for a smooth transition of responsibilities.
Documentation and Records:

Maintain proper documentation of the entire process, including account deactivations, equipment returns, data backups, and other relevant actions taken during the employee's departure.
Retain the documentation according to the organization's record retention policies.
