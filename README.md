# Documentation
SOPs, network topologies, etc.

* Create a repo for any documentation (such as SOPs, network topologies, etc.):

  - Include all required documentation as files in the repo.
   
    * Written documentation can either be:
   
      * Worked on as Google Docs and committed to the repo as PDFs.
     
      * Worked on and committed as Markdown files.
      * 
See the Project Requirements for details on what documentation your instructor is expecting.

System topologies and other visuals should be include as either image files or PDFs.

In the case of topologies, include the raw topology files 

 * (for instance, if using Draw.io, include the .drawio files).


Include any relevant information required for the operation of the demonstrated system. 

- On the README.md file, label and link all written and visual documentation.
