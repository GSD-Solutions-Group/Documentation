# Process for Managing Technology Needs during Employee Onboarding

### Assessing requirements: 
Prior to the employee's start date, HR or IT personnel gather information about the employee's technology requirements. This includes determining the specific hardware (e.g., computer, mobile devices) and software (e.g., operating systems, productivity tools) needed for their role.

### Procurement and setup:
Based on the requirements identified, the necessary technology equipment is procured. This may involve ordering computers, peripherals, software licenses, and any other tools or devices specified. IT personnel then set up the equipment, install software, configure accounts, and ensure that everything is ready for the employee's first day.

### User accounts and access: 
IT administrators create user accounts for the new employee, granting appropriate access privileges based on their role. This includes setting up email accounts, network access, and granting permissions to relevant systems, databases, or applications they will need to perform their job.

### Training and orientation:
As part of the onboarding process, employees may receive training or orientation on how to use specific software, tools, or internal systems. This can be conducted through in-person sessions, online training modules, or documentation and guides provided to the employee.

### IT support and troubleshooting:
Throughout the onboarding period, IT support is available to address any technical issues or questions the new employee may have. This includes assisting with software setup, troubleshooting hardware problems, and providing guidance on IT policies and best practices.

### Security measures:
To ensure data security, IT teams implement necessary security measures during onboarding. This may include setting up antivirus software, enabling firewalls, configuring access controls, and educating employees about data protection and cybersecurity practices.

### Ongoing support:
Beyond the initial onboarding period, IT support continues to be available to address any ongoing technology needs or issues that employees may encounter. This support may be provided through a helpdesk system, self-service resources, or dedicated IT personnel.
