Collaboration with cloud service providers 

If the issue is related to the underlying cloud services provided by third-party vendors, the support team may collaborate with the service provider's support team. This can involve sharing relevant information, logs, or engaging in joint troubleshooting efforts to resolve the issue.

Service monitoring and maintenance 

Regularly monitor the performance and availability of cloud services to proactively identify any potential issues or service degradation. This includes monitoring system resources, response times, error rates, and other relevant metrics. Performing routine maintenance tasks, such as updates, patches, or configuration changes, ensures the ongoing stability and security of the cloud services.
