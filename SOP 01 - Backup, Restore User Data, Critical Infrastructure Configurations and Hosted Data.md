# SOP 01: Backup, Restore User Data, Critical Infrastructure Configurations and Hosted Data
 
 ## Purpose:
 
 The Purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to outline procedures for the restoration of user data, identify and provide for the preservation of all critical infrastructure configurations, and to set forth guidance for the regular scheduling of backups for all relevant user files, databases, application settings, system configurations, virtual machines, hosted data, and any other critical data and configurations identified.

 ## Scope: 
 
 The scope of this SOP is to be Company-wide. All entities under the control of Micro Satellites will comply with this SOP and all allies, contractors, partners, etc. will include written language in any contracts, convenants, Statements of Understanding, and the like to be in compliance with these procedures.  

 ## Responsibilites:
 
 * CIO- To maintain the Backup and Restore Program in accordance with all company policies, accepted standards, and best practices 

 * CISO- Identify to the MSP all locations, drives, data, etc. to be maintained by the backup and restore program. Ensure the security of all PII and other sensitive information

 * MSP- Manage all backups in a manner provided for in writing (Preferably by an SLA)

 * Manager- Maintain the backup schedule as published

 ## Prerequisites:
 
 * There are no current prerequisites to this SOP.

 ## Procedure:
 

 #### Critical Data and Configurations: 
 
* Managers shall provide recommendations to determine which user data (identified by role-based permissions), infrastructure configurations, and hosted data are essential and should be backed up regularly. This will include (but is not limited to)user files, databases, application settings, system configurations, virtual machines, and any other critical data or configurations.

* CISO will approve all submitted recommendations and publish a quarterly list of all identified approved configurations to be maintained by the MSP. 

#### Determine backup frequency and retention:

* The CIO will determine what frequency backups should be performed based on the criticality of the data and configurations according to company information policy. 

* The CIO will establish a retention policy specifying how long backups should be kept, considering factors like data recovery objectives, framework compliance requirements, and applicable laws and regulations.

#### Implement backup automation: 

* The MSP may use automation to facilitate backup or tools to automate the backup process. Schedule regular backups at predefined intervals to ensure consistency and reliability. Automating backups reduces the likelihood of human error and ensures backups are performed consistently.

#### Choose backup storage location: 
Select an appropriate backup storage location based on factors such as security, accessibility, and scalability. This could include external hard drives, network-attached storage (NAS), dedicated backup servers, or cloud storage services.

#### Test backups and verify data integrity: 
Regularly test the backup process by restoring data and configurations from backups to ensure they are valid and can be successfully recovered. Validate the integrity of the backed-up data to ensure it remains intact and usable.

#### Secure backups: 
Implement appropriate security measures to protect backup data from unauthorized access or tampering. This can involve encrypting backups, using access controls, and following best practices for data security.

#### Establish a disaster recovery plan:
Develop a comprehensive disaster recovery plan that outlines the steps and procedures to follow in the event of data loss, system failures, or other disasters. This plan should include the process for restoring backups and bringing critical systems back online.

#### Regularly review and update backup procedures: 
Conduct periodic reviews of the backup strategy to ensure it remains effective and aligned with evolving business needs. Update backup procedures and tools as necessary to accommodate changes in infrastructure, data volumes, or technology advancements.
